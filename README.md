## Execution/Testing

1. Download the zip file or clone this repository.
2. The source code is in the ```.rs``` file, the pre-built executable included under it. On linux, ```cd``` to the directory and run the code with:

```
$ ./<executable name>
```
For example, ```euler1.rs``` compiled with ```rustc``` will output a file called ```euler1``` which is the executable. These are already included in the repository. You would then:

```
$ cd ./path/to/rust-euler/euler1/
$ ls
euler1 euler1.rs
$  ./euler1


Note the space is included at the start of the command.
